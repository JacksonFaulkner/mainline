# Backend Chess Tests

This folder contains test coverage for chess-specific backend behavior.

## Coverage Areas

- API behavior and auth guards for chess routes.
- Analysis and commentary streaming logic.
- Openings lookup and data handling.
- Persistence/storage pipeline behavior.
- External service integration boundaries (for example, Bedrock and Lichess interactions).

## Test Style

- Unit-heavy tests for service logic.
- API-level tests for endpoint contracts and permissions.
- Manual/integration scenarios live in `backend/tests/manual/`.
