# Frontend Chess Features

This folder contains chess domain logic for the frontend that is not primarily presentational UI.

## What Lives Here

- API layer wrappers and request/response typing.
- SSE/event-stream handling for live analysis updates.
- Shared chess feature state and utility modules.
- Table column definitions for chess history views.

## Boundary

- Keep reusable chess behavior here.
- Keep visual rendering and layout details in `frontend/src/components/chess/`.
