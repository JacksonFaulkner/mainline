# App Layout Routes

This folder contains authenticated application routes rendered inside the shared app layout.

## What Is Here

- Primary product surfaces such as play, analysis, history, openings, matchmaking, system, and settings.
- Route files map directly to in-app pages under the protected shell.

## How It Fits

- Route files orchestrate page-level data flow and component composition.
- Shared shell/navigation behavior is defined in parent layout modules (`frontend/src/routes/_layout.tsx` and related sidebar/common components).
